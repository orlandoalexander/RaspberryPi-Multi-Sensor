ACTIVE SENSORS, FREQUENCY OF DATA RECORDING & DURATION OF DATA RECORDING 

The sensor has the following sensors: 

1. Temperature
2. Pressure
3. Humidity
4. Light
5. Carbon monoxide
6. Nitrogen dioxide
7. Ammonia 
8. Particulate matter

Modify the values inside the brackets below for each active sensor with the following format 
(sensor number, delay between readings (secs), duration of data recording (mins)) 
i.e. to measure temperature and ammonia with a time delay between readings of 60 and 120 secs 
and a data recording duration of 4 hours and 7 hours respectively, you should write [(1,60,240), (7,120,420)]
'''
sensors = [(1,60,60), (2,60,60), (3,60,60), (4,60,60), (5,60,60), (6,60,60), (7,60,60), (8,60,60)]


'''
ADJUST TEMPERATURE TUNING FACTOR

The temperature reading must be adjusted slightly to compensate for the heating effect of the CPU (computer processing unit on the sensor). 
To determine the factor required to correctly compensate the tenmperature reading, 
set 'calculate_temp_factor' to True and follow the instructions in the documentation (README.md).
Note: if you want to calculate the temperature tuning factor, 'calculate_gas_factor' must be set to False.
'''
calculate_temp_factor = False

factor = 1.31


'''
GAS CALIBRATION

To obtain gas readings in ppm, you must first calibrate the sensors by taking readings of gas concentration in an open space away from buildings (e.g. a field).
To calibrate the gas sensors, set 'calculate_gas_factor' to True and follow the instructions in the documentation (README.md).
Note: if you want to calculate the gas calibration factor, 'calculate_temp_factor' must be set to False.

calculate_gas_factor = False
